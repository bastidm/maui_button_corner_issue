This is a reproduction of a .NET MAUI issue (https://github.com/dotnet/maui/issues/22591) where circular button detect inputs like they are squares. 

This image has the square area of the `Square shaped` button highlighted. Tapping anywhere within this area causes the input to go to the `Square shaped` button, so the transparent corners of this button stop inputs going through to the buttons underneath.
